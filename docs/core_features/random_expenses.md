## Data Model
- **Name:** Description of purchase.
- **Value:** Cost.
- **Date:** Date of purchase.
- **Status:** Defaults to `paid` (unlike Bills), but supports `pending` if it's a planned future purchase.

## Distinction from Bills
- **Bills:** Recurring, fixed dates (Rent, Utilities).
- **Random Expenses:** Variable, spontaneous (Dinner out, Uber, Emergency repair).
